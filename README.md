# Data Stream Clustering file ingestion Engine
This project aims to contribute to the community working on data stream clustering. Using a well known platform, as moa (Massive Online Analysis), we built an engine that allows to simulate the ingestion of a stream, where data is then processed to a data stream clustering algorithm.
